Description 
Welcome to the final project for this course for beginning to learn how to code using Java. In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills you learned in this course to a simulated scenario.  In this project, you will create a console application for a grocery shop, which will calculate the total of grocery items chosen depending on the unit price and quantity. The tasks in this hands-on project correspond to the activities performed by a Java Developer who is creating a stand-alone console application.
